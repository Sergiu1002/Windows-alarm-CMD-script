# Windows-alarm-CMD-script
Alarm batch script for Windows Xp.

Uses windows media player to play an mp3 file from desktop at given time interval. After playing for the set amount of seconds, it kills the process.
You got to have the Windows volume and media player volume up, otherwise you ain t gonna hear anything.


Made and used for a school competition.
